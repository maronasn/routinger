# Contributing to Routinger

Open Source is driven by contributions. We are very happy seeing you here. We want to make the contribution process as easy and transparent as possible. It can range from (but not limited to):
- Reporting a bug
- Submitting a feature
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing features
- Becoming a maintainer

## How to contribute?
1. Check out the [issues](https://github.com/Routinger/routinger/issues) page.
2. If you want to contribute a new feature or solve a issue, it is recommended you make it an issue for others to have a brief look at what's happening.
3. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
4. [OPTIONAL] Update the Readme file.
5. Issue that pull request.

> **For Non-Coders**
>> If you are from a non-coding background and still want to contribute, you can work on the `artistic` labeled issues. The issue's discussion will contain a brief description of `how to contribute`, but mostly you will be asked to navigate to the `lib/dev_assets` folder and copy your assets that you want to contribute.

>**For Coders** 
>>People willing to use dependencies other than those listed in `pubspec.yaml` have to discuss it first in the issues tab. Therefore, we recommend you to first open an issue for the code you are going to change. You should make sure that:
>>-  The package you are going to use adheres to the new null safety protocols set by Flutter.
>>-  The version used should be a stable release version.
>>-  It should be compatible with the other packages that are in use and must not break them. If for some reason two packages are incompatible, you must also suggest a new package to be used and refactor the code accordingly before issuing the pull request.

## Any contribution you make will be under GPL 3.0
Your contributions will be covered under the same license GPL 3.0 as the whole project. You can contact the maintainers for more assistance.

## Report bugs using Github's [Issues](https://github.com/Routinger/routinger/issues)
Reporting bugs or making feature requests are as easy as filling out a simple form. We have made a bug report and feature request issue template to help guide you and reduce clutter.

## Some more tips
- Use a consistent coding style. Make sure to use the same spaces and tree structure as is used in the source code.
- Make sure the app's core functionality doesn't break before issuing a pull request.
- Make sure to not break different widgets.
- Do not make a single file too long to read.

## Final Word
Thank you again. The project would not be possible without your contributions.
